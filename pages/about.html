				<h3>Personal Philosophy</h3>
				<p>I value tolerance, understanding, candor, and punctuality. This is because I highly value diversity 
				and all these attributes are key to achieving tolerance in any society. These same values also help 
				me respect other cultures and thus, be able to communicate effectively.</p>
				<p>As for professionalism, I believe that it is linked very closely with strong work ethic like 
				punctuality, honesty, and a sense of responsibility. It is these same value that I highly respect and value 
				in others but especially co-workers</p>
				<p>I hope to be able to work for a software company that makes applications that help people in 
				their daily lives either through education, entertainment, or convenience.</p>
				<p>By the end of my degree, I hope to feel prepared for the workplace and capable of making a
				 difference to society at large.</p>
				<p>I am very active in extra-curricular activities. Currently, I am an active member of the Multicultural
				Leadership Organisation, the treasurer of the International Student Association and secretary of the STEM club.</p>
