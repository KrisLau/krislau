				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Title: PR F-Aquarius Arts Inventory</li>
					<li>Date: September 2017</li>
					<li>Course: Concepts of MIS</li>
					<li>Professor: Michael Sullenger</li>
					<li>Description:</br>Use Access to set up tables, create forms, create queries,
					 and then format and print an order report.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to this assignment, I had never used Microsoft Access before so suffice to say, 
				I felt a little daunted. Going into the assignment with close to zero knowledge of how to 
				use the software filled me with both trepidation and excitement. This is because I knew that 
				learning how to use it would be a valuable skill to pick up as it is one that is demand in 
				the job market.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completing this assignment taught me to utilize the features of Access in a 
				practical application which made it even more interesting. I learnt how to set up tables with 
				fields reminiscent of those in Excel, create forms for data entry, use queries to analyze 
				and filter data, and create reports in order to summarize and all the data into a digestible
				format. I also learnt a number of other useful things like applying hyperlinks, number, and 
				currency data types, sort records in ascending or descending order, save an Access Database 
				into a PDF, and link data entry forms to their respective tables.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reports at the end would have to be the highlight of the entire project for me because 
				I got to see how all the tables, forms and queries came together to produce a professional 
				report. The most frustrating part of the entire project was the Query Wizard which I had a 
				little trouble learning how to use but for the most part I found the project enlightening.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose this project because it is very pertinent to this goal as the database seems like 
				an application an actual business would use. Besides that, it would allow the business 
				(Aquarius Arts) to analyse their inventory data to help them decide what products to restock.
				Last but not least, it's because of all my projects using Microsoft Office, Access was the 
				software I had the least previous experience in using. So every step was a learning experience.
				That's why it is the project where I feel like I learnt the most and expanded my skill set greatly.</p>

				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Title: Save Your Fork</li>
					<li>Date: October 2017</li>
					<li>Course: Web Design &amp; Development</li>
					<li>Professor: Sandra Hambrick</li>
					<li>Description:</br>
						Amy Wu has asked for your help in redesigning her website, Save your Fork, a baking
						site for people who want to share dessert recipes and learn about baking in general. 
						She has prepared a page containing a sample dessert recipe and links to other pages 
						on the website.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I found this project rewarding because I used to run a food blog. All I could 
				think about while working on it was how I could apply the styles I was using in this website 
				to my old blog.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working on this website taught me how to create and manipulate drop shadows, use radial 
				gradient, use the transform property to create shapes, use the box-shadow property, utilize 
				border-radius to create rounded corners, and use the filter property apply graphical effects 
				like blurring or color shifting to an element.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting the navigation barâ€™s individual list item to look like tabs on a recipe box using 
				the transform property was probably the most satisfying aspect of the process but it was 
				also the most frustrating part at the same time. This is because it was the one I had the 
				most trouble figuring out but looked it very eye catching and professional once I managed to
				figure it out.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I ever revised this project, I would like to try recreating the entire site without 
				the help of the textbook or any of the provided files. I would also try to add more functionality,
				make the website more responsive, and figure out how to implement a filter by tag feature.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I chose this project is because it meets all the criteria of goal 1. It uses HTML 
				and CSS in order to create a visually appealing website that looks like it could be used by 
				celebrity chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Martha Stewart or even food channels like the Asian 
				Food Channel. I also decided on this project because it was the project I enjoyed making the 
				most because of the number of new properties I learnt to use.</p>
