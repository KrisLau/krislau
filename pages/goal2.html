				<ul>
					<li>Title: Customer Maintenance</li>
					<li>Date: March 2018</li>
					<li>Course: Programming 2</li>
					<li>Professor: Windell Hambrick</li>
					<li>Description: A Multiple-Document Interface (MDI) Windows Form application that allows the user
						to add retail and wholesale customers. It also allows the user to see all added customers in a
						list and delete anyone.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose to display this project as was my first gander at Multiple-Document Interfaces (MDIs)
					and I really enjoyed expanding my capabilities with Windows Forms. In this project, I learnt
					valuable skills for Windows Forms such as how to create an instance of a new form, share data
					between forms, and deal with problems that arise with MDI.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems that I didnâ€™t anticipate when I had initially completed the project was the
					null exception that would occur when a user closes the add customer dialog box. It should have been
					an obvious thing but I only found the error as I was testing the form to add to this portfolio.
					That made me reflect on my testing practices. It made me realize that I had to be 100% that I have
					tested all the possible situations that a user might get into. This might seem obvious but I think
					it is easily overlooked in the rush to complete a project.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project also served as a great segue to my next artifact which built on the ability to
					display multiple windows while adding onto it exponentially with the MVVM design pattern and the
					integration of databases.</p>

				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Title: Manga Super Store</li>
					<li>Date: May 2018</li>
					<li>Course: Advanced Programming Topics</li>
					<li>Professor: Windell Hambrick</li>
					<li>Description: A Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application that allows me to view all my
						favorite manga(Japanese comics) in a list. I can also edit any information and delete any manga
						in the details view. </li>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was challenging to complete because I struggled to understand the
						Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern as it felt like there were a hundred moving parts to
						grasp. To add to my confusion, this project also needed to be a Windows Presentation Foundation
						(WPF) application instead of the Windows Forms that I was used to. Not only that but we also had
						to integrate the application with our own database and at that point in time, I had never worked
						with databases before. So, I was really proud when I actually managed to complete the project
						with the look and functionality that I desired.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through working on this project, I learnt a vaudeville of things. On the database side of
						things, I learnt how to set up a database and write SQL queries to create, update, insert, and
						delete databases and rows in them. In conjunction with that, I learnt how to utilize Microsoft
						SQL Server Management Studio in order to create queries and view tables. On the application
						side of things, I finally grasped the concept of MVVM and managed to get all the pieces to fit
						together in my head. WPF also turned out to be not as daunting as I thought it would be.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, I think I found that I could pick up any skills I wanted to as long as I was
						willing to persist. I chose this project because I think it suits this goal very well as I have
						always thought about keeping a wishlist of manga so being able to make it on my own was a
						really cool project!</p>
