				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Title: Credit Card</li>
					<li>Date: November 2016</li>
					<li>Course: Intro to Programming</li>
					<li>Professor: Sandra Hambrick</li>
					<li>Description: A Windows Form application which allows you to create a credit card,
						add payments and charge the card.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose this project because the fact that the topic of this project is a credit card reminds
					me that the data software engineers work with can be highly sensitive. This hits home even more
					because all of my internships thus far have been in financial technology companies. One small
					mistake could cost someone their life savings and ruin their life. Thus, I believe that this
					application is a perfect fit for this goal as it helps one to develop an awareness of the ethics
					involved in protecting financial transactions and just general financial integrity.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason I chose this project is because even though this was a project from my
					introductory programming class, it feels like it is a micro version of what could be a real-life
					application and gave me a glimpse into what lay ahead. I learnt so many things through working on
					this small project since it was one of the last projects of my first semester. It helped me to
					gain confidence and build upon the skills I had learnt before such as working with scopes, events,
					try/catch exceptions, and testing in general.</p>
