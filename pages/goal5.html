				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Title: IT History</li>
					<li>Date: December 2016</li>
					<li>Course: Intro to Programming</li>
					<li>Professor: Sandra Hambrick</li>
					<li>Description: A Windows Form that displays fact about famous figures and events in the field of computing.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first collaborative program that most IT majors at Newman will make and it was
					honestly a pretty fun project to work on. We had to choose from 18 different topics that related to
					the history of computer science and then research it. After doing the research, we had to summarize
					three subtopics under that topic. Then, we had to implement it into the template that the professor
					gave us. At the end of the project, Professor Hambrick integrated all our projects into one and we
					ended up with the final project seen in the video. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that while the project was really simple, it gave us our first glimpse
					into what real world information system life cycle techniques. This because we had to analyze the
					pre-existing code and the problem that was presented to us. The design step was rather diminished
					because the design was already presented to us, but we did get to see how Professor Hambrick
					executed this step. We also had to test our code to ensure it works as well as anticipate all the
					things that could go wrong on the user’s end. At the end, we got to see the deployment of
					application through Professor Hambrick.</p>

				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Title: Handbag</li>
					<li>Date: April 2017</li>
					<li>Course: Programming 1</li>
					<li>Professor: Sandra Hambrick</li>
					<li>Description: A Windows Forms that mimics an order form for handbags.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project involved creating a Windows Form application where the user could select the type of
				handbag they wanted from a ListBox as well as the quantity. After adding those items, the uer would then
				be able to "Go to the Shopping Cart" where they would be able to select shipping options and their state.
				These options change the shipping charge and the tax rate applied onto the order. They would then be
				able to find the total of their order and that would be displayed at the very bottom.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose this project because we had to go through the development life cycle on our own in contrast
				to the ITHistory project. We had full freedom in the design of the form as long as it met the requirements
				of the assignment. We also had to design, mock up, and come up with test cases by hand so it made for a good
				exercise in the importance of planning and foresight in the development of a application.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, this project also felt like an application that would be used in the real world. It
				felt like a micro version of online shopping sites like Amazon or Ebay. That's why I think it is the
				perfect project to flex our development lifecycle muscles.</p>
